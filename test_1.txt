The

a

The

A

of
information
is
available
on
the

as
on
its
neuronal

In

of

and
three

of

were
detected
,
all
in

The
significance
of
these

in

is
unclear
but
the

of
the

of
one
larger
palindrome
with
the
end
of
the
translated
protein
sequence
that
has
homology
with
the

that
the
palindromes
may
divide
the
T2

into
several
functional

These

suggest
that

be
distributed

The

In

the

We
have
also
found
that
the
in

interaction
between
the
SV40
octamer
motif
and
the
lymphoid

-

was
negatively
modulated
by
a

present
in
the

from

.

Anoxia

Thus
,
multiple

be
responsible
for
the

modulatory

of
actin

were
compared
in
32
patients
suffering
from

.

From
these
results
,
it
is
concluded
that
EDLF
has
clear
vasoconstrictor
properties
which
are
not
due
to
adrenergic
or
calcium
entry
mechanisms
and
that
there
are
differences
in
the
vasoconstrictor
effects
of
EDLFs
with
respect
to
different
vascular
beds
.

Research
was
carried
out
on

the

obtained
were

A

It
was

that

that

On

From

is
about
25

that
